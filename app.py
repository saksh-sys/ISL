        This application is built to recognize **Indian Sign Language (ISL)** gestures using a deep learning model. 
        The model is trained on a dataset containing **36 classes (A-Z & 0-9)** using **MobileNetV2**.

        ðŸ”¹ **Dataset**: Indian Sign Language (ISLRTC)  
        ðŸ”¹ **Model**: Pre-trained MobileNetV2 + Custom Classification  
        ðŸ”¹ **Framework**: TensorFlow & Streamlit  

        ### How It Works:
        - Upload an image of a hand gesture.
        - The model processes and predicts the corresponding sign.
        - Results are displayed instantly with high accuracy!
